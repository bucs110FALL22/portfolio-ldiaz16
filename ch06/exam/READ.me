# CS110 Midterm Exam

## This code gives the user an option of creating a major city skyline (think new york city) or a smaller scale city (Pittsburgh or Austin). The Code creates a road before going through the buildings

 ## Have to work on scaling, it works fine when you enlarge it but id like it to work better if i could understand how the dimensions work better. I'd like to add windows or maybe a couple other strcutures in the future aswell as make sure the buildings dont overshoot the road i made. Also theres a random pen stuck in the middle and I have no idea how to get it out ive tried almost everything

## any help/advice would be appreciated, even if it sucks i want to get better
